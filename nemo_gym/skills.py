"""Agent skills: a directory of skills made available to an agent at rollout time.

Skills follow the open `Agent Skills standard <https://agentskills.io/specification>`_
used by Codex CLI and Claude Code. A skill is a *directory* containing a ``SKILL.md``
file (YAML frontmatter + markdown body) plus optional supporting files. The ``skills.path``
config points at a directory of such skill directories.

Skills are a run-level knob (specified on ``gym eval run``), applied to a fixed,
skill-agnostic dataset -- mirroring how ``prompt.py`` applies a prompt template. They are
*not* a dataset-row field, so the same dataset is reusable across skill variants. Each
rollout result is stamped with a ``skills_ref`` for provenance/grouping in reward profiling.

The ``skills_ref`` carries a content ``hash`` (a short sha256 over the skill directory's
sorted relative paths + file bytes) so that variants that mutate a skill *in place* at the
same path -- as optimizer loops like ACE, GEPA, and EvoSkill commonly do -- remain
distinguishable when comparing rollouts. Identity is derived from bytes on disk, so it
requires no cooperation from the optimizer.

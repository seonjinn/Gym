# CritPt Resources Server

Evaluates research-level physics solutions on the
[CritPt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CritPt-Benchmark/CritPt) benchmark by submitting
generated code to the [Artificial Analysis API](https://artificialanalysis.ai/documentation#critpt-api).

- Task type: multi-turn (two LLM calls per problem) + external batched API evaluator
- Domain: `other` (research physics)
- Tasks: **70** (PUBLIC mode requires submissions for all of them)
- Reward: aggregate accuracy from the AA API, distributed uniformly across the batch

> **Run commands and `env.yaml` setup**: see [`benchmarks/critpt/README.md`](../../benchmarks/critpt/README.md).

## Server Composition

CritPt uses a **custom two-turn agent** — `simple_agent` will not work:

- `responses_api_agents/critpt_agent` (Turn 1: solve; Turn 2: populate the code template)
- `responses_api_models/*` (typically `policy_model`)
- `resources_servers/critpt` (this server)

The full wiring lives in `benchmarks/critpt/config.yaml`, which chains all three plus the
dataset and Turn 1 / Turn 2 prompt configs.

## Batched Verification (unique to CritPt)

The AA API rejects single-problem submissions in PUBLIC mode — it requires all 70 problems in
one batched payload. The Gym framework expects per-rollout rewards via `verify()`, so this
server fakes the contract:

1. Each `verify()` call adds its submission to an in-memory dict keyed by `problem_id` and
   awaits a shared `asyncio.Future`.
2. When 70 unique `problem_id`s have accumulated, the last caller fires one POST to the AA
   API; the response resolves the future; all 70 waiters unblock together with the same
   aggregate accuracy as their `reward`.

This matches nemo-skills' behavior: aggregate accuracy is distributed uniformly across the
batch, so `pass@1` across the 70 problems equals the AA aggregate.

**Multi-repeat support (`num_repeats > 1`)**: each `verify()` joins the first pending batch
that doesn't already contain its `problem_id`, opening a new batch if every pending batch
already has it. With `num_repeats=N` and 70 problems, this produces N independent batches of
70 unique `problem_id`s — N AA API calls total, each scored as a separate run. Assumes
uniform `num_repeats` across problems (which `gym eval run --no-serve` enforces).

## Dataset Format

Two JSONL files coexist with different shapes:

- **`benchmarks/critpt/data/critpt_benchmark.jsonl`** (full 70-row dataset, gitignored;
  produced by `prepare.py`). **Flat-field**: each row has `problem_id`, `problem` (Markdown
  question), `code_template` (Python stub), and `uuid`. Prompt templating happens at
  rollout time via the dataset entry's `prompt_config:
  benchmarks/critpt/prompts/turn1.yaml`.
- **`resources_servers/critpt/data/example.jsonl`** (5-row hand-curated fixture,
  committed). **Pre-materialized**: same flat fields plus `responses_create_params.input`
  already filled in from the Turn 1 template, matching the convention of every other
  paired server's example fixture. Because it's pre-materialized, callers must NOT pass
  `+prompt_config` when running rollouts against this file (the framework rejects rows
  that have both).

## Observability

Both signals surface in the run log, prefixed with the resources-server instance name —
`(critpt_resources_server)` when launched directly from this server's config, or
`(critpt_benchmark_resources_server)` when launched via `benchmarks/critpt/config.yaml`
(the inheriting instance):

- Per-`verify()` log line at WARNING level:
  `CritPt verify #<N>: batch <B> at <K>/70 submissions buffered (problem_id=...)`
  where `#<N>` is a monotonic counter of all verify calls received since startup (useful
  when tailing the log with `num_repeats > 1`, since per-batch counts interleave but `#N`
  always increases), `<B>` is the pending-batch index, and `<K>/70` is that batch's fill.
- Batch-fire log line (WARNING level):
  `CritPt batch full (70 submissions); firing AA API.`
- On AA API failure, full exception + traceback is logged via `LOG.exception(...)` and
  every waiter in that batch is failed with the same exception.

`GET /status` returns the live buffer count:

```bash
PORT=$(grep -E "critpt(_benchmark)?_resources_server.*Uvicorn running" <run.log> | head -1 | grep -oE '127\.0\.0\.1:[0-9]+' | cut -d: -f2)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/status
# {"pending_batches": [47], "batch_size": 70}
# (with num_repeats=N, the list grows up to N entries — one per concurrently-filling batch)
```

On HPC: bind is `127.0.0.1` on the compute node — curl from the same host, or
`ssh <node> "curl ..."`.

## Replay recovery

`resources_servers.critpt.replay` is a scoring-only recovery tool for CritPt runs that fail
after hitting Artificial Analysis rate limits. The live server writes model submissions before
shipping a full 70-submission batch to AA. If AA rejects the batch because quota is exhausted,
replay can later read those cached submissions, skip anything already scored, and send only the
unscored full batches back to AA without rerunning model inference.

Replay requires the live server to persist its cache. Set `CRITPT_CACHE_DIR` before starting
the server:

```bash
export CRITPT_CACHE_DIR=results/critpt_cache
```

When set, each server launch persists `submissions.jsonl`, successful `aa_responses.jsonl`
records, and `partial_metrics.json` under its own `<timestamp>-<pid>-<rand>` subdirectory of
`CRITPT_CACHE_DIR`, so independent runs never share (and pollute) each other's cache. The exact
path is logged at startup (`CritPt cache for this run: ...`). After the AA quota resets, point
replay at that run's subdirectory:

```bash
RUN_DIR="$CRITPT_CACHE_DIR/20260707-110622-48213-1a2b3c4d"  # from the server startup log
ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_API_KEY="aa-xxxxx" <!-- pragma: allowlist secret --> \
  python -m resources_servers.critpt.replay --cache-dir "$RUN_DIR"
```

Set `unique_cache_per_run: false` on the resources server config to write directly into
`CRITPT_CACHE_DIR` instead (e.g. to resume a specific prior run's directory).

## Running servers

```bash
gym env start --benchmark critpt --model-type openai_model
```

## Smoke test (5 example problems)

**Note:** The AA API rejects sub-70 batches. To run e2e on the 5 example problems, the resources server
has one opt-in config knob:

- `fire_after: int` — fire the batch after this many real submissions arrive, then pad
  up to `batch_size` (70) with empty padding submissions for the missing problem_ids (drawn from the
  hardcoded canonical CritPt problem list, `Challenge_<N>_main` for `N` in 1..70)

Defaults to `None`/unset, so production behavior is unchanged. Set it only for testing purposes:

```bash
gym env start --benchmark critpt --model-type openai_model \
    '++critpt_benchmark_resources_server.resources_servers.critpt.fire_after=5'
```

## Collecting rollouts

```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent critpt_benchmark_agent \
    --input resources_servers/critpt/data/example.jsonl \
    --output results/critpt_smoke.jsonl \
    --num-repeats 1 \
    --temperature 0.0
```

What this exercises: agent runs Turn 1 + Turn 2 on exactly 5 problems -> 5 verify() calls
arrive -> server fires the batch after the 5th, pads with 65 empty padding slots -> real AA
call -> aggregate distributed to the 5 real rollouts.

## Tests

```bash
gym env test +entrypoint=resources_servers/critpt
```

Covers code extraction edge cases, partial/full/multi-batch buffering, the `/status`
endpoint, and the empty-code-still-counts-as-a-slot invariant.

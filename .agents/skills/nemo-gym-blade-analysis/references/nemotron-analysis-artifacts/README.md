# Original CVDP Example Artifacts

This folder contains only the original-CVDP Nemotron 3 Super golden analysis
artifacts from the source benchmark package:

- `nemotron-3-super-golden-report.md`
- `nemotron_3_super_golden_report_metrics.json`
- `nemotron_3_super_anchor_facts.json`

The large rollout JSONL is intentionally not included. Use these files only when
the user explicitly asks to inspect an original-CVDP example, asks to compare
against curated anchor facts, or the agent is confused about the goal and needs
a concrete completed BLADE-style report example. For original CVDP rollout
examples, use the existing files under `resources_servers/cvdp/data/`.

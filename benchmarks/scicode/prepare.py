"""Prepare the AA-aligned SciCode evaluation data for NeMo Gym.

Downloads the SciCode problems from HuggingFace and converts to Gym JSONL, one row per problem.
Each row carries the full sub_steps list so the agent can build the per-sub-step prompts and the
resources server can run each sub-step's test cases.

The benchmark uses only HuggingFace's test split, matching the current AA Intelligence Index setup.

This does NOT download test_data.h5 (the ~1 GB numeric test targets used for scoring). That file
must be staged manually at the path the resources server is configured to read.
